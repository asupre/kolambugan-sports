## 2026-08 — Session: tiebreaker rebuild, accounts, double-elim group generator

- Tournament ties (ML): replaced the round-robin playoff + random-draw fallback
  with a per-group SINGLE-ELIMINATION tiebreaker (byes, decisive). Deviation from
  the originally-documented round-robin approach.
- Physical-sport structure FINALIZED with stakeholder: 4 groups ->
  double-elimination within each group -> 2 qualifiers per group -> Top 8
  single-elim knockout. Resolves a contradiction in the prior spec (which had said
  "no group stage / one straight double-elim bracket"). Doc updated to match.
- Built + proved the arbitrary-N double-elim group generator (byes,
  losers-bracket wiring, 2 qualifiers). Was flagged the "hardest remaining
  algorithm."
- Accounts: added full provisioning/reset/guarded-delete panel. Security model:
  temp passwords shown once (bcrypt is one-way); delete blocked for accounts with
  match history (protects the enteredBy audit trail) and for the last super admin.
- Billiards: scored per match as a plain win/loss entry (no live per-point
  scoring), inside the same double-elim structure.
- GridFS openUploadStream({ contentType }) is silently ignored by this driver version — store the mimetype in metadata too and read it back with a fallback in sendFile, or files download instead of displaying.
